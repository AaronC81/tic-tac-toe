# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a really simple tic-tac-toe implementation using socket.io to show
how a turn-based multiplayer game could be created.

It's pretty easy to cheat in this, because the server does very little 
validation, but it works as a proof-of-concept.

## Usage
  1. Install everything: `npm install`
  2. Run the server: `node server.js`
  3. Go to `<your ip>:8000` on two different devices and play!

You need to click the `Reset everything` button after each game.
